#CSE PROJECT 
1.PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The traditional Snake and Ladders board game is fun but manual gameplay requires a physical board, dice, and players to manage movements.
This project aims to create a Python-based digital version of the game that can be run on any computer terminal.
The objective is to simulate the board, dice rolls, snakes, and ladders automatically, making the game easy and quick to play without physical resources.

2. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:
The project covers the creation of a console-based Snake and Ladders game.

It includes dice rolling, player turns, movement on the board, and snake/ladder effects.

The scope is limited to two players and a fixed 100-cell board.

The project focuses on basic Python logic, not graphics or GUI.

The game ends when any player reaches exactly 100.


3. Target Users
Beginner Python learners who want to practice loops, functions, and conditionals.

Students who need a simple and clear Python project for academic submission.

Anyone who enjoys classic board games in digital format.


4. High-Level Features

 Automatic Dice Roll: Random number generator for each turn.

 Ladders & Snakes: Predefined positions that move the player up or down.

 Two-Player Gameplay: Alternating turns, clear display of moves.

 Win Condition: Player must reach exactly 100 to win.

 Console-Based Interface: Easy to run on any system with Python installed.

 Error-Free Movement Control: Prevents movement beyond 100.
